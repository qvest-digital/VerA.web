VerA.web is structured in these subprojects:

• common (this repository)
• core
• export
• online-anmeldung
• rest-api

There is also the secret “environment” repository and a few
Docker-only repositories, which we will ignore for now / in
this licence audit, as its focus is on VerA.web itself, not
the obnoxious Docker packaging which isn’t mandatory anyway.

Dependencies are thus (lower includes upper):

                              ┌────────┐
                              │ common │
                              └┬──┬───┬┘
                               │  │   │
                               │  │   │
                       ┌───────┴┐ │   │
                       │ export │ │   └──┐
                       └┬───────┘ │      │
                        │         │      │
                        │         │      │
              ┌─────────┴┐  ┌─────┴┐  ┌──┴───────────────┐
              │ rest-api │  │ core │  │ online-anmeldung │
              └──────────┘  └──────┘  └──────────────────┘

Only the lowest ones are actually shipped. This makes it hard
to create a suitable LICENCE file each, but given that there’s
only one optional component (online-anmeldung) here, whose
architecture, in addition, is a bit of a conundrum, creating
one suitable global LICENCE file, plus one for online-anmeldung,
is possible and attainable — we probably should ship the file
from the “common” module while including it in the WAR files
of both rest-api and core; online-anmeldung can ship its own
file, directly in the webapp probably (perhaps it might include
the contents of the common LICENCE file)?

Problems:

There is currently no parent POM, and thus also no shared
management of versions of dependencies; they diverge as has
been detected during the audit.
